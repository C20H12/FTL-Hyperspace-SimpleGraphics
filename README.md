### Features
- Utility functions for displaying all kinds of sprite images 
- Support for playing whole animation sheets 
- Highly customizable placements, sizes, time, and more 
- Also allows drawing of shapes to accompany your sprites 
### Initiative
This library was made to provide an abstraction over the raw exposed functions that Hyperspace offers, which is hard to read and lacks documentation. Because of the nature of the graphics functions, they must run on render events. Which often leads to hard-to-understand code. Therefore, this also provides modders with a consistent syntax for displaying sprite images.    
Special thanks to __vertaalfout#3043__ for providing with the first versions of the functions that renders animations.
